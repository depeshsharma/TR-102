Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This technique is useful for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms and for data visualization.

Imagine a dataset of 100 features about students (height, weight, grades, etc.). To focus on key traits, you reduce it to just 2 features: height and grades, making it easier to visualize or analyze the data.

Here are some popular Dimensionality Reduction algorithms:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensions by transforming data into uncorrelated principal components.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Reduces dimensions while maximizing class separability for classification tasks.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): Breaks data into non-negative parts to simplify representation.
Locally Linear Embedding (LLE): Reduces dimensions while preserving the relationships between nearby points.
Isomap: Captures global data structure by preserving distances along a manifold.
