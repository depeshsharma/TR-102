Logistic Regression in Machine Learning:
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class. It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False or 0/1.
Types of Logistic Regression:
1. Binomial Logistic Regression
2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
3. Ordinal Logistic Regression
