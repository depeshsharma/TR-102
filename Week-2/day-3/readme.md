K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm generally used for classification but can also be used for regression tasks. It works by finding the "k" closest data points (neighbors) to a given input and makesa predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression).

Example: Imagine you're deciding which fruit it is based on its shape and size. You compare it to fruits you already know.

If k = 3, the algorithm looks at the 3 closest fruits to the new one.
If 2 of those 3 fruits are apples and 1 is a banana, the algorithm says the new fruit is an apple because most of its neighbors are apples.

Distance Metrics Used in KNN Algorithm:
1. Euclidean Distance
2. Manhattan Distance
3. Minkowski Distance



Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in the data. It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog.
