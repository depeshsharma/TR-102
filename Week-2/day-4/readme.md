=>A Decision Tree helps us to make decisions by mapping out different choices and their possible outcomes. It’s used in machine learning for tasks like classification and prediction. In this article, we’ll see more about Decision Trees, their types and other core concepts.

=>A Decision Tree helps us make decisions by showing different options and how they are related. It has a tree-like structure that starts with one main question called the root node which represents the entire dataset. From there, the tree branches out into different possibilities based on features in the data.
1.Root Node 
2.Branches
3.Internal Nodes
4.Leaf Nodes

=>There are mainly two types of Decision Trees based on the target variable:
Classification Trees: Used for predicting categorical outcomes like spam or not spam. These trees split the data based on features to classify data into predefined categories.
Regression Trees: Used for predicting continuous outcomes like predicting house prices. Instead of assigning categories, it provides numerical predictions based on the input features.


Random Forest Algorithm:
Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses many decision trees to make better predictions. Each tree looks at different random parts of the data and their results are combined by voting for classification or averaging for regression. This helps in improving accuracy and reducing errors.

Working of Random Forest Algorithm
Create Many Decision Trees: The algorithm makes many decision trees each using a random part of the data. So every tree is a bit different.
Pick Random Features: When building each tree it doesn’t look at all the features (columns) at once. It picks a few at random to decide how to split the data. This helps the trees stay different from each other.
Each Tree Makes a Prediction: Every tree gives its own answer or prediction based on what it learned from its part of the data.
Combine the Predictions:
For classification we choose a category as the final answer is the one that most trees agree on i.e majority voting.
For regression we predict a number as the final answer is the average of all the trees predictions.
Why It Works Well: Using random data and features for each tree helps avoid overfitting and makes the overall prediction more accurate and trustworthy.
