**Activation functions in Neural Networks :**While building a neural network, one key decision is selecting the Activation Function for both the hidden layer and the output layer. It is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. Without this non-linearity feature a neural network would behave like a linear regression model no matter how many layers it has.

**Types of Activation Functions in Deep Learning :**
1. Linear Activation Function
2. Non-Linear Activation Functions
3. Exponential Linear Units
