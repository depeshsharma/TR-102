**A Guide to the DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm**

DBSCAN, which stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a powerful clustering algorithm that groups points that are closely packed together in data space. Unlike some other clustering algorithms, DBSCAN doesn't require you to specify the number of clusters beforehand, making it particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.

DBSCAN revolves around three key concepts:

1. Core Points
2. Border Points
3. Noise Points
